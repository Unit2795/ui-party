<h1>UI Party</h1>

A collection of components from different UI libraries.

# Shadcn/ui
- Some components have not yet been updated to React 19
    - https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/issues/5906
    - https://makerkit.dev/blog/tutorials/update-shadcn-react-19
- Quite verbose. Compared to other libraries, having to write a lot of code to get the same result.
- Nice having full control over the component source, may never need to touch this, but it's good to have the option.

# Material UI
